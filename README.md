There is much talk about the effects of globalisation. It is clear from the Covid-19 pandemic that the world is interconnected. But has the movement of people changed the culture so much that it is no longer obvious where you are?

New York (USA), Paris (France) and Tokyo (Japan) are great cities, regularly appearing high in lists of top global cities (see, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city). If globalisation causes the loss of cultural identity, it would be most obvious in the metropolitan areas of these cities.

One way to investigate this is to look at the types of venues that are present in these metropolitan areas, such as restaurants, fashion houses, banks and museums. I looked at such information about the most popular venues in each of the metropolitan neighbourhoods in these cities. What I found is that cultural identity is alive and well. While it is true that restaurants, coffee shops and Italian restaurants are popular everywhere, subtle reminders of cultural differences remain. Tokyo residents use convenience stores, and Parisians frequent bistros.

Maybe these differences reflect the way in which venues are described, rather than what they actually provide. But, either way, there is a difference in the way that people think about the places they go to when they are in New York, Paris or Tokyo. And isn't that what is meant by culture?
